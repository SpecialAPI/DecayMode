# Decay Mode
Adds random Decay to all enemies at the start of combat. Seeing all your hopes and dreams get completely crushed by a Far Shore Giggling Minister has never been this fun before!

Also adds the Decay Mean option, which makes the randomized Decay draw from the Bronzo pool. This can be toggled in the config file:
```
{Brutal Orchestra directory}/BepInEx/config/SpecialAPI.DecayMode.cfg
```
